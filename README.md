# Android-API-Maps
Android project that connects to Node_Socket.io to use sockets and to Laravel-API to makee API calls. 

Using the http://www.geonames.org/export/web-services.html API to get a location's country based on its coordinates.

The main idea of the application is to let any number of users connect to a room and play a game where they 
have to guess a country based on a clue that is given (e.g. "Countries containing the letter 'A'") and then a winner 
is decided based on the number of correct guesses.
